He is currently a full-stack developer at Sanity.io - a platform for structured content, delivering developer-friendly APIs and a modern, collaborative, headless content management system. With a never-ending enthusiasm for programming, he loves taking on projects big and small, and is always seeking to find new ways to challenge himself. When he can break away from coding he enjoys playing board games, taking his miniature schnauzer for long walks or drinking craft beer and thinking about the next project to play with.",
